Content strategy is one of those new-fangled terms that is likely to result in puzzled expressions amongst the kinds of business stakeholders for whom UX may also still be a bit of a novelty. Whether or not the term itself is used, the changes that are being forced upon businesses by customers mean that content strategy can now be found in the most unlikely of places. It might be called something different and the people who are doing it might not acknowledge it but the decisions they are having to make are ones that a content strategist will recognise.

A technology transfer is one of the driving forces behind this reluctant revolution in the way businesses now have to think. As little as 5 years ago, work was where all the cool, expensive technology was to be found. Sure there was great stuff to be had at home but in terms of processing power and affordability, the technology you could find at work probably had the edge. Nowadays, the situation has completely flipped. Your average person probably has a more powerful computer at home or in their pocket than they do at work.

With greater power comes greater expectations of what, how and when content can be consumed. The speed of this change has caught many businesses by surprise. Often they don't have the resources to respond anymore, a combination of outsourcing, downsizing and employee churn having left them bereft of the decision-making capabilities required to respond to the challenges.

Not that they won't have tried to do something. There will undoubtedly have been a few failed projects with ambitious sounding codenames. In the time it takes to brainstorm the name for a bold new initiative however, the customers may have already flocked off somewhere else.

It's in this environment that you can start to see a certain type of person emerging. Someone who can make smarter hypotheses about the future and learn from past mistakes. The Accidental Content Strategist.

You might think that the Accidental Content Strategist would have a background in content creation, perhaps a progressive Marketer or Product Manager. In my experience, the kind of person who gets the need for content strategy is more likely to have a technical background. There are a couple of reasons why I think this is the case.

Firstly, marketing is still very much focussed on the tactical. The turnover of personnel within a marketing team coupled with a reliance on external agencies means that there are few able to take the longer term view that a strategy requires. Technical people have usually been around longer and are more likely to have had frontline experience of failure. Content strategy is as much about what you don't do.

Secondly, the driving force behind the market changes that businesses must respond to is technological by nature, specifically the transfer of technology from business to customer that I alluded to above. Technical people are more likely to understand that the nature of the problem is as much about content curation, the frameworks that need to be in place to support content in all it's forms.

If you are involved in content strategy in some way, you'd be wise to start looking closely at the people within your business or your client's business. Some of them may be your accidental best friends.
