The main topic for the ThoughtWorks Experience Design (XD) team in the EU this year is "outreach" to other communities both inside and outside the company. One of these communities within ThoughtWorks is the Business Analysis (BA) community.

As part of our local office day at ThoughtWorks this year, I helped run a joint XD/BA session on domain modelling with my colleagues Diana Adorno and Jeremy Sutherland. Domain modelling is a technique that almost anybody can learn quite quickly but also one that can produce artefacts with long terms value for agile teams. There are also many ways to create a domain model, from rich pictures to entity relationship diagrams, and they often result in some very intense debate about the right nouns and verbs to use in describing the (damn) thing.

For our example domain, we chose "the coffee shop" as this was something that everyone was guaranteed to have at least some familiarity with. We only had an hour to run the session so participants were asked to do a small amount of homework beforehand. If they happened to visit a coffee shop the morning before the session, they were asked to think "beyond the barista" and notice what happens, what people use to help them do their work. Sketches, notes, pictures, anecdotes from the staff - anything that would give them some raw material to analyse later. This also helped introduce the notion of researching through observation, an important skill to learn for anyone who wants to create useful software.

After a brief introduction, we split the participants up into small teams, taking care to ensure that each team had a mixture of roles within it. The teams then had 20 minutes or so to work together on a diagrammatical representation of how a coffee shop worked. The different approaches that each team took were fascinating to observe.

One team began by writing a long list of nouns first. Thinking about a branded chain of coffee shops, they managed to identify lots of other uses of the coffee shop besides coffee: selling CDs played in the shop, providing free wifi to patrons. Another team considered the example of a well-known, local, independent coffee shop. Using cut out pieces of paper so they could easily rearrange the items in their model as their understanding evolved, they focussed on the process of ordering and serving coffee that they could recall from observation.

After the time was up, we asked the teams to stop working on their models and come together as a group again so they could present them back. The models that the teams created were as varied as their methods for generating them. One team had made a distinction between the "customer" who buys the coffee and the "consumer" who drinks it. This split was evidence of how user-centred analysis of a domain can differ from business-centred analysis, often resulting in disagreement about what labels to use. Another team, comprised mostly of senior developers, had opted to do a deep dive into "barista training" to consider the process behind the process.

To wrap up the session, we looked at some examples of domain models from projects that some of us had worked on. All the differences in approach and outcomes we had seen were also in evidence here. The examples I provided demonstrated how I mainly use domain models as a way to fast track my understanding of an unfamiliar subject area so that I can have meaningful conversations with colleagues and evolve my understanding as a project progresses. Jeremy showed some examples of how he has used domain models to facilitate high level conversations with clients regarding unnecessary complexity within their business and how best to plan programmes of work to address the issues.

As a result of running this session, we have since identified a long list of other useful techniques that we want to explore further through this kinds of collaborative working. By taking full advantage of the cross-functional pairing of roles, we can examine the value of our analytical tools from a much broader perspective.
