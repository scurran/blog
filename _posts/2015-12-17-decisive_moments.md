When I think about how I have contributed to projects that I have worked on over the years, it becomes clear that my role as a designer is quite different to that of my colleagues. It’s not just that I have a different set of skills from them or that I work on different things. I also have a different understanding of the impact I can make, which is less about effort than it is about timing. From memory, here are my decisive moments.

The time when I made a paper prototype from a cereal box to demonstrate my understanding of a “mobile device” for managing store inventory. The client had created a prototype of Excel running on a laptop being pushed around on a trolley. My cereal box wasn’t well received but I like to think it made the obvious impracticality of their working solution clear.

The time when I made the client recreate their entire application form on the walls of their office. I had no clear plan for this workshop but thanks to the enthusiastic support of my colleagues we made the problem visible and forced the client to confront how onerous the journey would be on a mobile phone.

The time when we had spent 5 out 6 weeks on some cool technology for an innovation lab project but still had a horrible, inappropriate interface. I spent 2 days creating a simple mobile ui and an iconic identity. Our most successful innovation lab ever.

The time when I spent 3 hours scribbling the entire user journey in slices of frontstage to backstage activity on a whiteboard. The client had never seen their entire service expressed in a single visual before and it gave us obvious choices for slicing up the work.

Same project, 6 months in, when I story mapped the entire backlog to prove we couldn’t finish on time. The resulting conversations secured more money to get us to the finish line.

The time when we were mired in trying to scope the work for replacing dozens of linked spreadsheets in a complex domain. I suggested that we ignore them altogether and focus on the abstracted activities we needed to support via a visual map of inputs and outputs. This gave us the understanding we needed to label and prioritise the releases we would need.

The time when we were trying to make sense of a ton of numbers in a cost model on behalf of a diverse group of stakeholders and I suggested creating a consistent info graphic for each item under consideration and using it to tell a story. It brought focus and direction to conversations that would otherwise have been lost in spreadsheets.
