Yesterday I decided to find out what was on the small black USB stick that had been sitting on my desk for a few weeks. My wife had found it when clearing up after the village fete. Spare USB sticks are always useful and figuring the owner had forgotten about this one, I decided to take a look at what was on it before wiping it and popping it in my rucksack.

I plugged it in and took a look at the files. There were a bunch of videos with odd looking titles. I played one. It was the view from a camera mounted to the front of an armoured vehicle as it drove along a desert highway. I looked again at the words in the titles - "Basra", "Dilligaf". This must be Iraq, I thought. I had a small sense of foreboding about what I might see next. This was probably a result of having seen the Wikileaks helicopter gunship footage again a couple of days earlier at a screening of [We Steal Secrets](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1824254/). Stupid thoughts started forming. Could this USB stick have been deliberately left for someone to find? At Hamsey Village Day? Yeah, right. Shut up.

I watched a little more and it became clear that this must have belonged to a soldier that had been stationed over there. The footage was all pretty innocuous stuff. The driving footage went on for an hour without incident, there were slideshows of pictures from everyday army life set to music. In amongst the files was the aforementioned "dilligaf.wmv". I thought this must the name of another place in Iraq. More pictures of army guys pulling faces, some smiling Iraqis set to a soundtrack of a live performance by some Australian folk singer. I listened on, intrigued. The guy was singing about how he identified with the likes of Ned Kelly and their disrespect for authority then the chorus came in:

> Do I Look Like I Give A Fuck, Dilligaf

> Am I being direct enough? Dilligaf

I realised that there was nothing sinister about these videos. They were just mementos of boredom and camaraderie from a soldier's time spent stationed in Iraq. Now that I write that though, I can't help thinking about how Bradley Manning said that stuff like the helicopter gunship footage was traded freely and openly amongst soldiers, so you never know, there might have been something there.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything to indicate who it belonged to, otherwise I would try to return it to it's rightful owner. The stuff probably has sentimental value. To me they are just a curiosity. But also an interesting way to tell the story of how I first heard [Dilligaf by Kevin Bloody Wilson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzgoXoOqnn0), on an unknown soldier's USB stick.
