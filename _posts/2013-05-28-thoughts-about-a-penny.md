If you see a penny, do you stop to pick it up, as the old saying goes? Hardly seems worth the trouble, right? Bending over, obstructing pedestrians all for the sake of a piece of shrapnel that has no real worth. Of course nobody wants to be a litter bug with their small change but beyond that impulse what is there? The motivation not to pick it up probably stems from the same place as "keep the change" when you only get a single copper and a receipt for your recurring purchase.

There was a technical studies teacher at my high school called Mr. Bell. I can't remember his first name just that everyone just referred to him as "Techie Bell", an accurate if unimaginative nickname. He was pretty old and not far off retiring and he had some old-fashioned habits that kids loved to make fun of. One of these was that he would always pick up coins of any denomination that he found lying in the street.

Walking home after school, if anyone spotted Techie Bell on his way home, they would attempt to throw coins in his path, just so they could watch him stoop to pick them up. The coins that were thrown were always 1p, never more than 2p, as the humour seemed to reside in how laughably worthless Techie Bell's efforts were.

I like to think he kept one of those giant Bell's Whisky bottles somewhere in his house, half full of pennies, on it's way to being full of whisky once more. He was from a generation that remembered the value a penny held, both real and symbolic. When I was at school, the penny was already on it's way out as a token of exchange by itself, Bazooka Joe's having doubled in price by then.

If not a penny what about 5p then? Would that be worth your while to pick up off the pavement? How about 10p then? Surely there's some reward in that there silver? You must be O.G. then. Only gold deserves your efforts. Just be careful some prankster hasn't glued it to the pavement.
